# Recipe Book

Our project will be a React based recipe book. It will allow users to utilize web APIs in order to create/store/edit recipes that will be kept on a database for user consumption. Our goal is to create a method to easily keep track of foods you adore and those youâ€™d like to try your hand at creating.
